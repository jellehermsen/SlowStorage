SlowStorage
===========

SlowStorage is a tiny Javascript library that you can use in conjunction with Apache Cordova. It allows you to use the file system as a fallback storage, when the amount of space you get by using regular HTML5 web storage isn't enough. Function calls are modelled after web storage.

NB: This project has moved to [SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/~jelle/SlowStorage).
